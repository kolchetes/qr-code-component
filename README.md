## My process

It was a pretty easy webpage, all I had to do was write some simple HTML and put it inside a
container to make a card with CSS.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I didn't learned anything new to be honest, but it was a nice warm up project. I gave up on learning to code, now I'm comnig back =)

### Continued development

My goal is to keep practicing web development focusing on semantic html and mobile first css.
